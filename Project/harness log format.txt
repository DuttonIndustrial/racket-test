Harness Log Format


A harness log is readable by racket.

All messages that are interesting to the harness are of the form....

(test-instance-id time arg1 arg2 arg3)
	where the test-instance-id is a very large random number used to uniquely determine the tests run id

The test can interact with the harness by outputting messages to the harness though standard output or standard error ports



(test-instance-id time 'test test-description ...)
	
	the testrun with test-instance-id was started

(test-instance-id time 'timeout timeout-at ...)

	the test requested that it should be considered timed out at timeout-at time
	
	
(test-instance-id time 'timeout-reached)

	the test's timeout was reached and the run was terminated by the harness

(test-instance-id time 'gc-interval gc-interval ...)

	the test requested that the harness should begin collecting garbage at each gc-interval milliseconds
	
	
(test-instance-id time 'gc current-memory-use major? start-time end-time)
	
	a garbage colleciton was performed by the harness, with the given memory statistics probived from the garbage collector

(test-instance-id time 'limit-memory limit ...)

	the test requests that memory be limited by the harness to limit bytes
	
(test-instance-id time 'memory-limit-reached)

	the test reached its requested memory limit and was terminated

(test-instance-id time 'abort ...)

	the test requested that the test run be aborted immediatly
	
	
(list-rest `,test-instance-id rest)
